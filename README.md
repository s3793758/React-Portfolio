## Description

This is my personal resume website built with ReactJS. I am using my own React resume website template that can be found <a href="https://github.com">HERE.</a>

## I'm looking for work

I am currently completing up final iteration of freelancing projects, but I will be actively looking for work after project is compelted. My location preference is Sydney, but I am open to remote work and can potentially make other arrangements if the right job comes along.
